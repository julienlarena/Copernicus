# Copernicus

Copernicus is an algorithm (written in Python 2.7 and Fortran) to find the LLTB metric from data. You will need recent versions of numpy, scipy and matplotlib to run it. The documentation has been written as an ipython notebook. To see the notebook go to the Copernicus directory and run

$ ipython notebook

This should open the documentation in your web browser. If nothing happens you probably don't have ipython notebook installed. You can install it from your software manager (eg. Synaptic) or using pip (preferred)

$ pip install ipython[notebook]

You should be able to run the scripts interactively from your browser by selecting on one of the code blocks and clicking on the run icon. Make sure to run each block of code starting with the first.
