    "This is a collection of scripts written to fullfil the rerquirements of my Ph.D. The Copernicus algorithm is meant to reconstruct the background geometry of a the Universe without invoking the Copernicus principle (CP). As a result it can be used to test the CP. At the time of writing current data were not sufficient to confirm or refute the validity of the CP (see <cite data-cite='bester2'> [Bester, 2015 </cite> ](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=find+eprint+1506.01591)). The code is therefore made available albeit with no gaurantee that it is able to perform its advertised duty.  "

This includes the data to set the priors and to perform inference. You can use any combination of data as long as you modify the Master.py file to load it. The main class implementing the algorithm is the SSU class (for Spherically Symmetric Universe) in the Master.py file. This class has a method called load_Dat() that should be modified to load the relevant data. There are at least two compulsary data sets viz. the longitudinal expansion rate $H_{\\parallel}(z)$ and the matter density $\\rho(z)$. The data for these two functions will be used to set the priors but they may also be used for inference. If you want to incorporate a specific data set to perform inference with you should modify the get_Chi2() method to compute the $\\chi^2$ for that particular data set and add it to the others. If you are using an observable that I have not yet computed you will have to add a method that computes that observable using the output from the CIVP. But more on this later. \n"
